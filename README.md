## Project Goals

Develop a low cost (less than $500) wide-spectrum environment sensor with the following capabilities:

* **Gas** (or similar) - atmospheric gas detector (using chromatograph or similar); ideally determine the type and volume of each gas
* **Lightning** - electric storm (IC and CC) detector; ideally determine storm severity, plus distance & direction from sensor
* **Disdrometer** - precipitation detector; ideally classify hydrometeor (rain, sleet, snow, hail), hydrometior size, velocity and distribution
* **Fire** - optical fire detector; spot fires in 360Â° visual range of sensor (gas and/or particulate sensor would provide additional detection based on presence of smoke)
* to be continued
